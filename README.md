# Nucleo-STM32G474RE SFP and FULL Ravenscar Runtimes

This repository contains Ada software for the implementation of Ravenscar Short Foot-Print (SFP) and FULL Runtimes for the STM32H743 CPU with a complete modified Ada Drivers Library (ADL) from [Adacore](https://www.adacore.com) for its peripherals. It was used [AVD2Ada](https://www.github.com/Adacore/svd2ada) for generating the peripherals specification files, [bb-runtimes](https://www.github.com/Adacore/bb-runtimes) for generating the Ravenscar real-time runtimes and an ADL structure with all the necessary drivers.

The main board used for developing this software is the NUCLEO-H743ZI, from [ST Microelectronics](https://www.st.com), that has connectors for Arduino shields, ST Zio and ST MORPHO expansion connector, so you may connect any Arduino shield on it and develop your own software. There are several examples for testing the runtime with drivers, including a DC-AC 50/60 Hz inverter from 12 V to 220 VAC with a low frequency transformer. The sinusoidal wave is synthesized with PWM modulation.

You may use the GNAT Programming Studio from Adacore or Visual Studio Code from Microsoft to cross-compile these sources. For VSCode, it has a `.vscode/tasks.json` file that permits to check syntax and semantic, compile, build, clean, convert elf to hex and bin files and flash hex and bin files to board. Both IDEs need the [ST-LINK](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink) (version 1.7 or later) to flash the executable to the nucleo board, but the VSCode has the option to use STM32CubeProgrammer and flash elf files.
